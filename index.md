## Prerequisites

This is an abstract, proof based course. I will assume that you have experience
with mathematical proofs and you know how to read and write them. All homework
and exam problems will ask you to prove various statements on your own. The main
technical prerequisites come from calculus: you should be comfortable with the
notions of a continuous function (of one and several real variables) and a limit
of a sequence of real numbers. Prior knowledge of operations on sets (union,
intersection, difference, product)  will be helpful, but I will review this at
the beginning of the course.


## Textbook

The corse will follow lecture notes posted on this website.
If you would like to use a published text as a supplement, a popular and good
textbook is [Topology by J.R. Munkres](https://www.amazon.com/Topology-2nd-Economy-James-Munkres/dp/8120320468/ref=pd_cp_14_1?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=8120320468&pd_rd_r=4VZWC9KGC5G31YR4T9ZA&pd_rd_w=5hg0t&pd_rd_wg=60htE&psc=1&refRID=4VZWC9KGC5G31YR4T9ZA).
There are many other good options. You can check with me if you would like to
use some other book.



## Homework

Homework problems will be assigned on Wednesdays and will be due on Wednesday
the following week. Students registered for MTH 527 are required to submit homework solutions
typeset in LaTeX. Students registered for MTH 427 are encouraged to use LaTeX as
well: this is the standard tool for preparing mathematical and other technical texts
and it is good to get acquainted with it.

You can collaborate on homework problems, but you must write solutions entirely on your
own, not copy them. Do not search for solutions on the web, in textbooks etc. -
this defeats the purpose of homework which is to let you practice your own problem
solving skills.
