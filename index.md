# Course Information

Lectures, recitations and office hours will be conducted on the course
Discord server. If you have not received an access link to the
server, email me at [badzioch@buffalo.edu](mailto:badzioch@buffalo.edu?subject=MTH 427/527).  

### Class times

**Lectures (Discord):**  
* Mon 2:30PM - 3:50PM
* Wed 2:30PM - 3:50PM   

The class will be divided in two groups, and each group will attend only
one weekly meeting. This is meant to partially offset the time that you will
need to spend on watching videos with lectures, and also to assure that our
live meetings are small enough that everyone has a chance to talk during them.

Group assignments are as follows:

<table>
<tr>
<th>
one
</th>
<th>
two

</tr>
<tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
2
</tr>
</tr>
</table>

## Prerequisites

This is an abstract, proof based course. I will assume that you have experience
with mathematical proofs and you know how to read and write them. All homework
and exam problems will ask you to prove various statements on your own. The main
technical prerequisites come from calculus: you should be comfortable with the
notions of a continuous function (of one and several real variables) and a limit
of a sequence of real numbers. Prior knowledge of operations on sets (union,
intersection, difference, product)  will be helpful, but I will review this at
the beginning of the course.


## Textbook

The course will follow lecture notes posted on this website.
If you would like to use a published text as a supplement, a popular and good
textbook is [Topology by J.R. Munkres](https://www.amazon.com/Topology-2nd-Economy-James-Munkres/dp/8120320468/ref=pd_cp_14_1?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=8120320468&pd_rd_r=4VZWC9KGC5G31YR4T9ZA&pd_rd_w=5hg0t&pd_rd_wg=60htE&psc=1&refRID=4VZWC9KGC5G31YR4T9ZA).
There are many other good options. You can check with me if you would like to
use some other book.

## Grading

| **Homework**                   | 40% |  
| **Class participation** &nbsp; | 20% |
| **Final Exam**                 | 40% |  


## Homework

Homework problems will be assigned each Wednesday and will be due on Thursday
the following week. Students registered for MTH 527 are required to submit homework solutions
typeset in LaTeX. Students registered for MTH 427 are encouraged to use LaTeX as
well: this is the standard tool for preparing mathematical and other technical texts
and it is good to get acquainted with it.

You can collaborate on homework problems, but you must write solutions entirely on your
own, not copy them. Do not search for solutions on the web, in textbooks etc. -
this defeats the purpose of homework which is to let you practice your own problem
solving skills.

Homework assignments will be collected through [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com).

## Class participation

Class participation credit will be based on two components.

**Class attendance.** You can earn up to 10% of the total course credit
for being present and on time during class meetings. You can miss one
class meeting without a justified reason. Each subsequent unexcused absence
will lower your participation credit by 2%.

**Weekly digest.** As a part of each homework you will be asked to submit
a short (2-3 sentences) writeup on your study from the previous week.
You can write for example about

* what you have found interesting (or boring)
* what you have found difficult (or easy)
* how do you feel about the course
* anything else you want to share.

You will be also asked to submit any questions that you have and that
you would like to see discussed during a class meeting.  

You can receive up to 10% credit for submitting these digests. You can miss one
such assignment without loosing any credit, but your weekly digest credit will be
lowered by 2% for each subsequent missed assignment.   

I may award extra credit to students who are especially active in the course.
I may also offer some extra credit opportunities for giving short presentations
on some topic etc.


## Exams

There will be no midterm exams. There will be an oral final exam, its schedule
will be determined later.   


## Incomplete Grades
